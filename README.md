# Problem Description

* In the audio streaming industry various recommendation systems have been built which provide songs that one may like based solely one’s music listening experience, thus failing to cater to a wide music taste. People tend to discover new music through friends’ recommendations. To bridge the gap and fully discover the power of music that could potentially bring people together, build relationships, and further expand their music community, we recommend new friends and their favorite songs to users based on their similarity of music tastes in our project. Because of the strong social connections, this would strengthen the tie between users and the music streaming platform, reducing the churn rate and increasing profits as a result. 
* The purpose serves to cater a wide array of potential customers which include music enthusiasts, social music discoverers, casual listeners, music collectors, music bloggers and influencers and music streaming service users
